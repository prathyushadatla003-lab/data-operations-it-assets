IT Asset Data Operations & Insights
Overview
This mini-project demonstrates a complete data engineering and analytics workflow using a real-world IT asset dataset. It covers:

Cleaning raw data using Excel
Indexing cleaned data into Elasticsearch using Python
Transforming and enriching data with derived fields
Visualizing insights using Kibana
Documenting the process and findings
The dataset simulates real-world enterprise IT asset management challenges.


Phase 1: Excel Data Cleaning
Objective: Prepare the raw dataset for ingestion into Elasticsearch.
Dataset: it_asset_inventory_enriched.csv
Cleaning Techniques Used:

Remove Duplicates:Used Excel's Data > Remove Duplicates on the hostname column.
Trim Extra Spaces:Applied =TRIM(A2) to remove leading/trailing spaces.
Used Flash Fill for quick formatting.
Handle Missing Values:Replaced blank cells with "Unknown" using =IF(A2="", "Unknown", A2).
Standardize Date Format:Ensured all dates in operating_system_installation_date follow YYYY-MM-DD format.
Output File: it_asset_inventory_cleaned.csv


Phase 2: Indexing Data to Elasticsearch
Objective: Load cleaned CSV data into Elasticsearch.
Script: index_data.py
Purpose:

Connect to Elasticsearch using API key
Read the cleaned CSV file
Prepare bulk actions
Index data into it_asset_inventory_cleaned2
Result:

✅ Data successfully indexed into Elasticsearch


Phase 3: Data Transformation & Enrichment
Objective: Enhance indexed data with derived fields and cleanup.
Script: transform_data.py
Transformations Performed:

Reindexing: Moved data to a new index it_asset_inventory_enriched
Derived Field - risk_level:"High" if operating_system_lifecycle_status is "EOL" or "EOS"
"Low" otherwise
System Age Calculation:Calculated system_age_years from installation_date
Data Cleanup:Deleted records with missing hostname or provider = "Unknown"
Update Existing Records:Used _update_by_query to add risk_level and system_age_years to existing documents
Result:

✅ Data enriched and cleaned in Elasticsearch


Phase 4: Visualization and Insights
Tool Used: Kibana
Visualizations Created:

📊 Assets by Country
📊 Lifecycle Status Distribution
📊 High vs Low Risk Assets
📊 Top OS Providers
Screenshots Saved In: visualization_screenshots/
Business Insights:

⚠️ 40% of assets are EOL — indicating an urgent need for OS upgrades, especially in INDIA and BRAZIL.
🌍 Most assets are concentrated in the US and India.
🛡️ High-risk assets are primarily running outdated operating systems.
